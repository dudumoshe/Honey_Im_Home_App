Answer: in android's SmsManager you can supply a PendingIntent for delivery. this pending intent could start a broadcast or a service that will have some logic. I will add the to the intent's extras the same notification ID used for the previous notification. This way, I can make another notification with the same ID and different content and the manager would update the current notification.
